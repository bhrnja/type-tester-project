# Type Tester Project

This is a public project to create **simple** and **open source**, component based
type testers used to interactively change attributes of Typography.

## What do these attributes include?

Normally a type tester includes adjustable attributes such as:

- Font Family
- Size
- Weight
- Width
- Italic Angle / Slant
- OpenType Features
- Ligatures
- Ordinals
- Diacritics
- Small Caps

And, many more attributes.

## What are your goals?

First and foremost, I'm setting out to create a **free** and **open source** type tester which
can be used on any web and type foundry projects. I'll be accomplishing this my starting
small. The first attainable goal will be to achieve a working type tester that can
change the **font family** and **size** of the typography.

One my initial goal has been met, I will begin to add additional features and attributes
like **Weight, Width, and Italic Angle / Slant**.

## Any future additions?

Upon reaching a finished state of the outlined basic type tester, future additions
will include support for interactively adjusting **OpenType** features such as **Ligatures,
Ordinals, Diacritics,** and much more.
